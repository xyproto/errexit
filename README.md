# errexit

Instead of doing this in a script:

```bash
if false; then
  echo 'error: something went wrong' >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

It is possible to use `errexit`:

```bash
false || errexit -e 'something went wrong'
```

This will print `error: something went wrong` to `stderr`, send `SIGPIPE` to the parent process and exit with error code `141`.
